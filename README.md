# Bash script to install Nominatim on Ubuntu

Tested on 14.04 using Postgres 9.3

http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim/Installation

After the repository has been cloned from github, proceed by making your own `.config.sh` file based on the `.config.sh.template` file.

Running the installation script `run.sh` (as *root*) will:

 * create a *nominatim* user
 * download all the necessary packages
 * download the planet extract as defined by the `.config.sh` file
 * build the Nominatim index
 * create a virtual host
 * setup Munin plugins (Note: server needs to be Munin node)

The *root* user is required to install the packages, but most of the installation is done as the *nominatim* user (using *sudo*).


## Setup

Add this repository to a machine using the following, as your normal username (not root). In the listing the grouped items can usually be cut and pasted together into the command shell, others require responding to a prompt:

```shell
# Install git
sudo apt-get -y install git

# Tell git who you are
git config --global user.name "Your git username"
git config --global user.email "Your git email"

# Clone the installer
git clone https://github.com/cyclestreets/nominatim-install.git

# Move to the right place
sudo mv nominatim-install /opt
cd /opt/nominatim-install/
git config core.sharedRepository group

# Instantiate a config file
cp .config.sh.template .config.sh

# Edit .config.sh
# At least set a password for the nominatim user
# Disable ```setupMuninGraphs``` if you don't have a Munin node running
# Rest of file defaults to processing Andorra - which should take about half an hour

# Run the installation
sudo ./run.sh
```
